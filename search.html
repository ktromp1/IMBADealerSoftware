        <h3>My hope is to have this page be more dynamic than QB. When searching for something, I'm going to include tags that you can click to narrow your searches down easily.</h3> 
        <p>for example, let's say a bike came in last week, but I can't remember the guy's name, however, I do remember the bike. I can look up his bike by the vin, click the "Name" tag, and his name will pop up with all recently added documents (invoices, notes, consignment agreements, condition report, etc.) Unlike QB, how it brings up many unwanted things, making searching for specific things very difficult if you don't have exact information</p>
